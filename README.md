## Motivation and Package Selection

Angular provides the backbone, GitHub Pages offers a public URL, and GitHub Actions ensures a CI/CD pipeline. Practical choices for a seamless development experience.
To achieve a polished look, I used Tailwind CSS.
To achieve continues integration, I used `angular-cli-ghpages` library.
The project secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets.
I designed the project with code reusability in mind.
